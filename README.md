[How Mark Rober is beating the YouTube Algorithm (Genius Strategy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wuse0RBRiE&ab_channel=PaddyGalloway)
The video breaks down the 3 mayor steps Mark Rober does for beating or "giving" youtube's algorithm what it wants in order to grow, he also claims that anyone can do them. The 3 steps fly around the ***youtube recipe*** that is some kind of triangle that helps indicating what of what you need to have in order to succes, here you have an image.

So the 3 steps are: 

- Have massive retention. Mark does this at the bigging of the video: he gives us the "what, why and how". Next he keeps up the **"pacing"**, he does that by sometimes adding some *creative* **montages** about of what is to unfold, the most important thing to consider in this "pacing" section is to keep increasing the "beat" **up** towards the climax, and I what I refer of "up" is having a pace with no **dull or unnecessary/unfitting** moments.  Other youtubers think the same as Mark, (alk4apon3 claims that this is one of the most important things to consider). That's why in all of his twitch clips, he does put a good title, so you will give it a click, but the topic that the video says its not at the biggining of the video.


- Have killer metadata. So the thing here is to make people actually click on your video, and for this is always good to use the "meta data" that is nothing more than everything we use to describe a video. The main 4 things to describe are TITLES, THUMBNAILS, TAGS AND DESCRIPTIONS. The video says that the only ones that are worth paying attention to are: titles and thumbnails. The argument is that neither Rober or Mr. Beast actually use no tags, and they both keep the descriptions very short, the only thing that is worthy to use description for is to use the first 15 words as a teaser of the video, because those will be displayed on the "search page". Now, the other meta-components that are worth paying attention for is the title and thumbnails. Let's start with the title; Mark's titles are so clickable because they are super "pragmatic", meaning that they are 50 characters low and they are so specific so that there is no ambiguety (just what it is, straight to the point). Finally, the use of thumbnails is so important. The video says that people appreciate more "home-made" thumbnails, that contain no more than 4 - 5 words and that actually represents the action of what is going on, also the video also talks about ***tubebuddy***, internet paid "tool" that helps reviewing the thumbnails.

- Giving videos space to breath. Mark uploads one per week, the argument of the video is that it is because youtube no more rewards "more content", but rather the "quality". 

*I think that the important thing on the video is to make sure you are making the best version of the video so it can be well-ranked, so the goal is to have a good ranked video, and then, another good ranked video, and then another, another... so the algorithm will give you preference, cause it will know you are doing things "fine" and people is staying on your videos, that is excatly what youtube whants; to have more people stay at the platform's videos! and what so more than a chain of good videos!*


Now lets have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHuUHOpbuCc&ab_channel=CathrinManning) youtube video. Altought the video is just pure talk and the arguments are often not well structured, she is just saying what every youtuber knows:

[![Screen-Shot-2020-12-08-at-7-14-30-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HkhCR17G/Screen-Shot-2020-12-08-at-7-14-30-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/pmz757Zk)
So, with some help into the argument-constructing, there are a couple things we can get from this


- Get on **search**. She doesn't explain why, but *for me* is really simple: *If you are a small channel, the only way to get noticed by the audience is to actually get noticed. If, nobody knows your video exists, there is no way of increasing the click-through rate and therefore there's no engagement.* So first you gotta get "the chance"! She says that the best way to get it is by putting your tags in the right position (appearing on search)

- Focus on the **click-through rate**, because just having good "search" is not good enough. Here she says the first good argument. "If you get recomended in the youtube frontpage, but nobody is actually clicking on your video, so... because youtube wants people to actually click the videos it recomends, if nobody is picking up your video, logically youtube will took it down, and never recomend it. 

- Maintain **Video engagement** through your video. Here she gives us a valid argument. If Youtube wants to make sure that the content he is recommending is actually likeable for the user; then the more likes, retention time and clicks on your videos, the more you'll get them recommended.

By this point, she gives us some kind of conclusion: 
First you have to get people to click on your video, you do this by putting tags and having great thumbnails. This gives us click-though rate.

Then, your video has to be freakin amazing, so that your video actually engages people and makes them stick to it. You do this by making people like, comment and stay in your video. This gives us retention time.

[How to set Metadata on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwyvz9yGVpU&ab_channel=BrightonWestVideo) 

This video is just about setting the options of metadata in YoutubeStudio. But there is a couple of things to consider.

- He uses **tubebudy** for tags, title, etc..
- He does say that tags are the most important (he uses a lot)
- He includes tags in the description
- He includes captions

###### Video #4

[How to Rank YouTube Videos In 2020 (7 NEW Strategies)](youtube.com/watch?v=b0fJuFdl6nM&ab_channel=BrianDean) This guy begins the video with a "taste" on how he has used his 7 strategies to actually rank up into youtube's search. Then he continues with a little bit of storytelling into the "why" of the video, saying that he was completly lost, and he spent months into trying to figure out "How" to rank up the videos, but the only thing he could actually find, was nothing more than general recomendtions and things that actually sounded really logical, such as: "Do great videos" and "Make a good use of tags". So, at this point of the video he is trying to tell us the ***why he is unique among the other STUPID MDFK ASS SHITTY videos***. The video in my opinion is looking great at that point, so let's have a look of those 7 strategies:

- _Boost your click-through rate_: He says:"Youtube pays a lot of attention to your click-through rate because youtube itself recommends it in the StudioPage". The next question is: How can I increase my CTR? The video suggest using **brackets and parenthesis** at the end of the video's title, saying that the text in brackets gives someone a ***sneak preview*** into your video, which makes it more likely to click on it. He also sites [this studies](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-2505556912-pdf/Data_Driven_Strategies_For_Writing_Effective_Titles_and_Headlines.pdf) which serve as the argument fundament.

> I guess the most important thing here is to ask "Why a sneak preview makes a video more likely to be clicked on?" (Beggin the question)

- _Use engagement signals_: Those are things like; comments, likes, shares, subscribes; so the more you get, the more you rank. He defends the argument saying that a "[recent industry study](https://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors)found a correlation between the engament signals and the succes of it. The other statement that helps fundamenting the tesis is that youtube itself also recommends maitaining you audience engaged, so the more they feel engaged to the video, the more interactions and the more interactions, the better the ranking. Next he add the "**How to**, where he stated that there was 2 ways to use them. The first one is to ask the viewers a multiple choice question or ask for their opinion (something that is super easy to answere), something like "_Y tu que dices, si te compras la 3060Ti? o te lo vas a gastar todo en tu ruca?_" and avoid asking people to think about something, because people love to give their opinion, but they hate thinking... The second one is telling people to subscribe in an original way, not in the same boring way, he takes into consideration Dr.Mikes example (Intersting and original)

> I have my concerns in the way he defends the argument, he says that he retreived the info from a "recent study" but that term is in his entire form very amiguous. Which study? From whom? From where? all these questions come into place. The interesting thing here is that the actual study comes direclty from the youtuber's webpage. In scence that aint a problem if the study is well made, and I mean well-fundamented.

- _Embed your video_ To defend this, he sites this study ["YouTube SEO Ranking Factor Study](https://www.briggsby.com/reverse-engineering-youtube-search) by BRIGGSBY. Saying that top ranked videos have 78% more embeds than average. 

> It will be totally worth it to actually read the study. Again, in virtue, if the study has valid arguments, it should be a good peace of information.

- _The TSC Tag formula_. This has everything to do with tags. "Is no secret that tags can help your videos rank higher" but he claims that using them the wrong way can be harmfull, because youtube uses them for trying to figure out at which content does it belongs to and if you load it with tons of tags, youtube will have a hard time understanding what your video is about. So, a good use of them is what comes helpfull; that's why he recomends the TSC FORMULA, that is better explained in the video at min [5:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0fJuFdl6nM&ab_channel=BrianDean) 

> Right of the bat we know this guy defends the idea of using tags. And its interesting that he developed his own way of using tags, or perhaps that method is from someone else, it will be interesting to find out if the method is actually good or not.

- _Rank in suggested video_. This refers to the right part of the page, where a list of videos showed. He claims that youtube's "up next/suggested" videos bring more views than the videos that appear on"search". Before telling us the How to get your video to be on the "up next section", he explains us the two main factors that youtube considerates to suggest a video: 1. THE TYPES OF VIDEOS YOU RECENTLY WATCHED, 2. THE VIDEO YOU ARE CURRENTLY WATCHING. So, if you optimize your video with the same keywords that a popular video uses, you will have a pretty good chance of showing up next to that videoin the suggested video area. In conclusion, if you see a video in your niche with tons of views, try to use some of their keywords as you _synonym_ and _category_ tags in your video  

> There is no explanaition/study/article onto "Why youtube's watch section is more viewable than the search section page", he jumps directly into the "How to do it..." Again, it might be a good strategy, but, there is no actually fundament where the strategy can relly, so it's hard for me to evaluate. Even tho there is no fundament in the "Why", I think that the part of "How" has pretty logical fundaments.

- _Increase watch time_. First is important to not confuse it with "audience retention", audience retention is the percentage of the video an user watch, meanwhile "watch time" is the accumulation of the total of hours all the viewers had made since the video came out. He uses youtube's advice to defend the idea, next he jumps into the "How"; planning, scripting, rehearsing, adding music, animations and transitions are the main recommendations.

> I think the premise "The longer you can keep people watching on youtube because of your content, the more your content may get surfaced" leans more to the audience retention concept. Because it says "keep watching" meaning an action, not an statistic. I think that if it was to be made for watch time It would've said: "The more time you get from people for watching your videos, the more your con.... ", perhaps I'm wrong, this guy is supposed to know about this things...  
Also I dont think the "How" part is quite enough, I suggest to dive more into this one. 


Even tho I have doubts of his sources, I do like that most of the strategies present a good structure: Thesis, argument, defence, argument, defence **(Why)** and then the **How** to do it. Its simple, and in some cases the arguments present "begging the question" falacies. Also I would've liked more if he made it even more handy, for example in the strategy 2, where he explains how to use engagement signals, everything is cool, but at the end of the idea of asking subscribers for specific things you think that it is the end of the strategy, but no... you still can do other things... So I would've prefered to have a sub title that said "3 ways use engagement signals" or maybe just a "there are 2 ways to use engage...", just something to actually clasify so we could identify better the content.
