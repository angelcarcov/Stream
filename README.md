[How Mark Rober is beating the YouTube Algorithm (Genius Strategy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wuse0RBRiE&ab_channel=PaddyGalloway)
The video breaks down the 3 mayor steps Mark Rober does for beating or "giving" youtube's algorithm what it wants in order to grow, he also claims that anyone can do them. The 3 steps fly around the ***youtube recipe*** that is some kind of triangle that helps indicating what of what you need to have in order to succes, here you have an image.

So the 3 steps are: 

- Have massive retention. Mark does this at the bigging of the video: he gives us the "what, why and how". Next he keeps up the **"pacing"**, he does that by sometimes adding some *creative* **montages** about of what is to unfold, the most important thing to consider in this "pacing" section is to keep increasing the "beat" **up** towards the climax, and I what I refer of "up" is having a pace with no **dull or unnecessary/unfitting** moments.  Other youtubers think the same as Mark, (alk4apon3 claims that this is one of the most important things to consider). That's why in all of his twitch clips, he does put a good title, so you will give it a click, but the topic that the video says its not at the biggining of the video.


- Have killer metadata. So the thing here is to make people actually click on your video, and for this is always good to use the "meta data" that is nothing more than everything we use to describe a video. The main 4 things to describe are TITLES, THUMBNAILS, TAGS AND DESCRIPTIONS. The video says that the only ones that are worth paying attention to are: titles and thumbnails. The argument is that neither Rober or Mr. Beast actually use no tags, and they both keep the descriptions very short, the only thing that is worthy to use description for is to use the first 15 words as a teaser of the video, because those will be displayed on the "search page". Now, the other meta-components that are worth paying attention for is the title and thumbnails. Let's start with the title; Mark's titles are so clickable because they are super "pragmatic", meaning that they are 50 characters low and they are so specific so that there is no ambiguety (just what it is, straight to the point). Finally, the use of thumbnails is so important. The video says that people appreciate more "home-made" thumbnails, that contain no more than 4 - 5 words and that actually represents the action of what is going on, also the video also talks about ***tubebuddy***, internet paid "tool" that helps reviewing the thumbnails.

- Giving videos space to breath. Mark uploads one per week, the argument of the video is that it is because youtube no more rewards "more content", but rather the "quality". 

*I think that the important thing on the video is to make sure you are making the best version of the video so it can be well-ranked, so the goal is to have a good ranked video, and then, another good ranked video, and then another, another... so the algorithm will give you preference, cause it will know you are doing things "fine" and people is staying on your videos, that is excatly what youtube whants; to have more people stay at the platform's videos! and what so more than a chain of good videos!
